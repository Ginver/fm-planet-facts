## My process

- identifying the elements in every screen size
- drawing a scetch of the positions of the elements
- building the components and positioning them
- started styling with mobile view then -> tablet then -> desktop

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- to get my way of mobile-first workflow
- to have a more in depth understanding and practice of flexbox
- to create a Next.js project for the first time and build an app in this framework

### Continued development

My next project will be something similar. I'd like to practice more in this framework and would like to repeat the process a couple of times to get more comfortable with it.

### Useful resources

- [Next.js documentation on how to make pages & routing]([https://www.example.com](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/navigate-between-pages/pages-in-nextjs)) - This helped me to gain knowledge of the routing and the pages of the app.
